# Unity - MobileNotifications
 
A cross-platform notification manager for Unity, designed to handle local notifications on both Android and iOS. The `NotificationManager` utilizes platform-specific handlers (`AndroidNotificationHandle` and `iOSNotificationHandle`) to streamline the scheduling and clearing of notifications.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports both Android and iOS notifications.
- **Notification Scheduling**: Schedule notifications with custom title, message, badge count, and delay.
- **Clear Notifications**: Clear all scheduled and delivered notifications on demand.
